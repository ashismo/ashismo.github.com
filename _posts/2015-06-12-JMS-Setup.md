## Introduction


 * JMS stands for **Java Message Service**. JMS is an API that provides facility to read, create and send messages. JMS is **asynchronous** (To receive the message, client is not required to send request. Message will arrive automatically to the client) communication. 
 * JMS is mainly used to send and receive message from one application to another.
 * Following are the messaging domain in JMS
   * **Point-to-Point messaging domain:** In this model, one message is delivered to one receiver only. There will be a **QUEUE** to hold the message until the receiver is ready.

## JMS Queue (Point-to-Point messaging domain) example

In Case of **Point-to-Point** messaging, **QUEUE** will hold the message until the receiver is ready to receive the message. Here, we shall be creating two JNDI in Weblogic 12c.


 * Create connection factory named **queuedConnFactory**
 * Create destination resource named, **myQueue**

Once JNDI is created, server and receiver application needs to be created. **Server** and **Receiver** needs to run in two different console.

Create the following in Weblogic server
SL NO | Type | Description | Object Name | JNDI Name
|---|---|---|---|---|
1 | **JMS Server** | JMS Server acts as a management container for resources **(Queue/Topic)** within JMS module. JMS module will be created inside **JMS Server** | **myJMSServer** | |
