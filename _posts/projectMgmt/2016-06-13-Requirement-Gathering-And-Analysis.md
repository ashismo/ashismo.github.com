## Introduction

The software requirements are description of features and functionalities of the target system. The requirement gathering process gathers the requirement from client then analyze the requirement document and finally **System Requirements Specification** document needs to be prepared.

## Requirement Elicitation techniques

The requirement elicitation process consists the followings


* **Requirement Gathering:** Developers understand from client/end user about the expectation from the software.
* **Organizing Requirements:** Developers prioritize the requirements based on the criticallity of the requirements.
* **Negotiation and discussion:** Ambiguous or unrealistic requirements require discussion with various stakeholders. 
* **Documentation:** Functional and non functional requirements need to be documented and made available for the next phase processing.
 

There are different requirement elicitation techniques. Few important techniques are listed below


* **Brainstorming:** An informal debate is held among the various stakeholders and all their inputs are recorded for further requirement analysis. 
* **Interface Analysis:**
* **Interviews, Survey and Questionnaire:**
* **Prototyping:**
* **Requirement Workshops:**
* **Delphi Techniques:** This is very famous technique of requirement elicitation. This techniques involves structured interaction among a group of experts on the requirements. The identity of the participating experts are kept confidential to avoid influent on the process. There can be round of inputs from the experts till the process is finalized. The facilitator will have multi round **one to one interview** with each expert on the questionnaires and collect their opinions and answers.
 

#### Brainstorming Techniques


* An informal debate is held among the various stakeholders and all their inputs are recorded for further requirement analysis. 
* Brainstorming session will have a facilitator and will have time limit for the discussion. 
* **Advantages**
  * Helps to generate new ideas
  * Helps to encourage involvement of participants
  * Focuses on a topic or problem and coming up with many ideas or solutions
* **Disadvantage**
  * During brainstorming session, ideas are not explored.
* **Consideration for Brainstorming techniques**
  * Brainstorming is useful early in the requirements elicitation process.
  * Brainstorming can help to generate wide variety of views of the problem and solution.
* Brainstorming sessions are ideally divided into two phases
  * **Idea Generation Phase**: It focuses on the gathering all possible ideas within the time limit
  * **Idea Consolidation phase**: In this phase, the ideas are getting revised, organizing and reviewed. In this phase, each idea gets evaluated, then combine ideas after removing duplicate ideas. Finally, ideas will be rated and ranked after discussing with the team
* Different types of brainstorming techniques
  * **Open Brainstorming**: Participants call out the ideas and are capture by the meeting facilitator
  * **Individual Brainstorming**: Project team member creates a list of features/ideas concerning project issue/risk and shares with the facilitator
  * **Structured Brainstorming**: Meeting participant silently write down their ideas and facilitator requests


#### Interface Analysis technique


* When a system takes input from multiple systems then the interface analysis techniques is preferred for the enhancement/change in that system. 
* **Context Diagram** helps in interface analysis because it defines the boundary between a system and its environment, showing the entities that interact with it.
* Interface analysis helps in sizing and estimations as well. As far as sizing is concern, the interfaces are considered as non-functional requirements
