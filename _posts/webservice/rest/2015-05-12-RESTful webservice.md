## Introduction

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is an architectural style and gaining popularity over SOAP webservices.
Below are the REST fundamentals


* Everything in rest is considered as **resource** and every resource is identified by **URI**
* All **resources** are handled by **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE** operations
* Every request is independent request hence it is stateless.
* Communication is done via representations e.g. JSON, XML over HTTP protocol.
