## Introduction

Web application scalability is very common problem that most of the java architect faces. In this blog, some of the important concepts will be discussed that an architect should know.

## Some of the important concepts

#### High Availibity

Availibility of an application means the application to be available without interruption to the user. High availibility is the need for any businees. Clustering of an application is the common and popular way of making an application highly available.

#### Scalability

When load of an application grows then current infrastructure may not be able to handle the load. So the infrastructure (e.g. system/network/processes etc) should be able to handle a growing amount of load if the infrastructure is scalable.   

Adding resource is the most common way of enhancing scalability of an application. It can be achieved in the following ways


* **Scaling Up:** Add more resources (e.g. RAM, storage, processing power etc) to the existing node
* **Scaling Out:** Adding more nodes to support more users
