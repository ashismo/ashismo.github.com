## Introduction

Dozer is a Java Bean to Java Bean mapper that recursively copies data from one object to another. Typically, these Java Beans will be of different complex types.
Dozer supports 


* simple property mapping, 
* complex type mapping, 
* bi-directional mapping, 
* implicit-explicit mapping, as well as 
* recursive mapping. 
This includes mapping collection attributes that also need mapping at the element level
