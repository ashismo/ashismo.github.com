## Introduction


* Software Design helps developers to develop and implement the user requirements in the form of software.
* There are different types of software design
  * **Architechtural Design:** 
    * Shows relationship between major modules.
    * Finalizes on the design pattern to be used.
  * **Design Design:** Focuses on the data structure representation
  * **Interface Design:** Shows the flow of the information
  * **Component Design:** provides a higher level of abstraction and divides the problem into sub-problems, each associated with component partitions
* Good software design will have the following features
  * Abstraction
  * Highly cohesive modules
  * Loosely coupled modules
  * Partitionaed
  * Maintability and
  * possibility of the forward engineering
* **Coupling** and **Cohesion**
  * **Coupling:**  is the degree of interdependencies between modules
  * **Cohesion:**  cohesion measures the strength of relationship between pieces of functionality within a given module
  * A good design will be loosely coupled and tight cohesion
