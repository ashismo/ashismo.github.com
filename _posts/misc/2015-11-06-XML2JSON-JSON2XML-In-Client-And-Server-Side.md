## Introduction

There are situations when we need to convert XML to JSON or vice versa. For example, you are writing json based REST web service application and there are some existng service that you need to use which takes only XML as input. Also the need could be other way around where you need to convert XML to JSON. Based on the requirement you may need to do this in Client side or server side. The client side XML2JSON or JSON2XML conversion is shown in this blog.
