## Java Code Analyzer
Analyzing java source code is an important aspest of good coding. It helps developer to findout the unused variables, dead code, deviation from the coding standard, possible bugs and many more. There are many open source Java code analyzers are available in the market.Few of them are PMD, SONAR, Find Bugs, QJ-Pro, JDiff, CheckStyle etc. PMD and SONAR are very popular in the industry. This tutorial gives brief on PMD and SONAR setup.

## PMD
PMD is a static rule set based Java source code analyzer that identifies the potential problems like:
<ul>
 <li> Possible bugs - Empty try/catch/finally/switch blocks</li>
 <li> Dead code - Unused variables </li>
 <li> Duplicate code </li>
 <li> Empty if/while statements </li>
</ul>
PMD report shows the indicative issues. It is upto the developer to decide whether the issue to be fixed. However, it is advisable that the developpers should fix priority 1 and 2 violations.

### PMD Setup in Eclipse
As the Eclipse is the most popular IDE so I have done the PMD setup in eclipse.
Steps to add PMD plugin in Eclipse is given below
<ul>
 <li> Right click on some project and check if PMD is getting displayed on the popup. If displayed then the PMD is already available in your eclipse. </li>

 <li> Restart eclipse </li>
 <li> Right click on some project and check if PMD is getting displayed on the popup(as shown in the above image).</li> 
</ul>

### PMD Rule setup in Eclipse
As mentioned, PMD is a static rule set based Java source code analyzer. There will be a default set of rules that you can edit/delete. You can add new rules. Also you can import a rule set. Go to 
 * Window->Preference
 * Expand PMD in the left hand panel
 * Select Rules configuration under PMD
 * All the rules will be visible in the right panel.
Now spend some time with the rules to understand how to edit/modify, import/export rules.
